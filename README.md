# 📊 Growth Analytics Stack

## Overview

This project analyzes user behavior and growth using event data. It builds foundational tables (`dim_users`, `fct_events`) and tracks key growth metrics like:

- Active, New, Retained, Resurrected, and Churned users
- Daily, Weekly, Monthly cohort retention
- Triangle retention visualizations
- Transaction type classification (Engagement vs. Miles)
